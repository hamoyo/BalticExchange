# BalticExchange QA Engineer Take-Home Task

This repository contains both **UI** and **API** automation projects as part of the Baltic Exchange QA assessment. It demonstrates test planning, execution, and automation for the following:

-  Sauce Demo (UI Testing with Cypress)
-  Restful Booker API (API Testing with Axios & Mocha)

##  Getting Started

>  Requires **Node.js** v14+ installed on your machine.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamoyo/BalticExchange.git
cd BalticExchange
```

---

##  Sauce Demo UI Tests (`sauce-demo-cypress`)

###  Install Dependencies

```bash
cd sauce-demo-cypress
npm install
```

### ▶ Run Tests

- **Headless (CLI):**

```bash
npx cypress run
```

- **Interactive (Cypress GUI):**

```bash
npx cypress open
```

Tests are located under:

```
cypress/e2e/
├── login.cy.js
└── cart_checkout.cy.js
```

---

##  Restful Booker API Tests (`restful-booker-api-tests`)

###  Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ../restful-booker-api-tests
npm install
```

### ▶ Run API Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Tests are located in:

```
test/booking.test.js
```

##  Approach & Strategy

- Designed clear and prioritized test plans for both systems.
- Wrote functional UI test cases based on user flows (login, cart, checkout).
- Automated high-value UI scenarios using Cypress.
- Automated end-to-end API scenarios using JavaScript (Axios + Mocha).
- Documented test results and defects manually where needed.
- Focused on readability, maintainability, and real-world structure.

---

##  Assumptions

- Sauce Demo credentials are publicly known (`standard_user / secret_sauce`).
- Restful Booker API requires a token for `PUT/DELETE`, sent via `Cookie` header.
- User-Agent header is added to avoid 418 rate-limiting.

---

##  Tools Used

- **Cypress** for UI test automation
- **Mocha** + **Chai** + **Axios** for API test automation
- **Excel/CSV** for test case documentation and execution results
- Manual exploratory testing for edge cases
